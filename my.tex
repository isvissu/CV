\begin{enumerate}
 \item Optimising Forward Pass of CNN for Face Recognition \\
 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{p{3cm} p{13cm} }
 Supervisor& Prof. Kolin Paul  \\
 Description& Static Timing Analysis (STA), FPGA / ASIC Design of a module to optimize the forward pass
calculations for a given convolutional neural network and images as input \\
Contribution& Implemented the FPGA design for the module to take Convolutional Neural Network and the input
images and compute the following weight calculations for the forward pass of the convolutional neural given as
input. Optimized area efficiency in implementation of the module. Tested on “Zynq board 7000”. \\

 \item Analysis and Security check of the Apks which can be obtained from alternative Play Stores.
 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{p{3cm} p{13cm} }
 Supervisor& Prof. Kolin Paul\\
 Description& To extract the permission which are asked in APK and raise security risks for the call graph generated and checking the malacious use of permission asked and not using any function call registered with the Permission asked.\\
Contribution& Implemented a python application to extract the information form the apk to know the basic details
of the apk. Then we used the function graphs which are generated using the call graph of the apk to find any possible
security threats. We identified malicious application which had constants like phone number or web url to snitch
information. We identified the permission gap between the apk listing and the permission used in the call graph of
the application. \\

 Description&Android Application development.\\
Contribution&Worked in Team (4) to develop and design the Android application. Got familiar with the project
developed so far and then worked with the team to draw new branches to the mother application and patch it with
the main application after a series of tests. We also designed UI/UX for the application. We worked on already
developed (partially) ecommerce application for medical appliance. Finally we changed the look and feel of the
application and we have removed the inherent web views which were directly used in native android application
derived from the website. We developed needy features for the application.\\
